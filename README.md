# GlyphPad

A mathematics pad for writing propositional logic and basic set theory.

# How it works:
GylphPad allows users to type short-codes which are rendered into mathematical 'glyphs'. Glyph pad currently supports a wide range of symbols commonly used in propositoinal logic and set theory. It also supports translation of a range of characters into subscript and superscript.


Glphypad is a work in progress.

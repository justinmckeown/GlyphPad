# GlyphPad

A mathematics pad for writing propositional logic and basic set theory. Originally created to help Computer Science students who needed something light weight for quickly writing basic equations which would render real time and which coudl be copied and pasted into other text editors. 

### How it works
GylphPad allows users to type short-codes which are rendered into mathematical 'glyphs'. Glyphpad currently supports a wide range of symbols commonly used in propositional logic and set theory. It also supports translation of a range of characters into subscript and superscript.

### Supported symbols 

#### Propositional Logic
* Negation
* Conjunction
* Disjunction
* Implication
* Logical Equivilence (if and only if)

#### Set Theory
* Element of (set membership)
* Subset
* Proper Subset (Strict subsets or proper inclusions)
* Superset
* Proper Superset
* Negation of all of the above
* Union
* Intersection
* Difference
* Cartesian Product
* Power Set
* Compliment

### Special Charcters
* N - Natural numbers
* Z - the Integers
* R - Rational Numbers
* Z language Dot operator
* Existential E
* Inverted A for 'For All'
* The Empty Set
